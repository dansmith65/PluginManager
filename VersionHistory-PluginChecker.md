    - old versions of a plugin may return an unexpected value to the Get ( InstalledFMPlugins ) function so it's recommended to always use the versionFunction parameter, to ensure compatibility when a client computer has and old version of the plugin already installed. (unless you can ensure that all clients either don't have the plugin already installed, or have a version of the plugin that returns a version to the Get ( InstalledFMPlugins ) function, in an expected format)
